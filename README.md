# gas-report-action

A Github Action that takes the result from `eth-gas-reporter`, parses it and creates a comment in the Pull Request (if any) with a gas usage report for each method of the tested contracts, also shows the variation of the average of each method compared to the last results from this action.

It also passes the value as an output of the step in `parsed_gas_report` as an array-like structure with elements following the schema `{ Contract: 'string', Method: 'string', Min: number, Max: number, Avg: number }`. Note: This output does not contain the variation of the average since the last run.


## Example result in comment
